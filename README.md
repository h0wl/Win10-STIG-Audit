# Windows 10 Enterprise DISA STIG C&amp;A

http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/os/windows/Pages/win10.aspx

I haven't seen, or looked hard enough, for a Windows 10 Enterprise audit script for DISA STIG that can be ran locally. So I'm starting one. Since I suck at Powershell I'm hoping to accomplish the following:

1. Get better at Powershell
  * Get better at scripting in general!
3. Logic for category selection and preferred output (CSV/HTML) 
4. Create shorthand bundle that has flexibility for ingestion
5. Make something useful that people would use and/or care about
